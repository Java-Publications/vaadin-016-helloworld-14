# Backend meets Frontend: Roles, rights and their impact on the UI
Rights and roles can be quite tricky in a web application. Above all, you should not dodge at the beginning, otherwise changes or extensions will be even harder. Apache Shiro helps with the rights and roles, but then you have to integrate them properly.


## How to start
To play with this you only have to start the main - method from the class  ```org.rapidpm.vaadin.helloworld.server.Main``` and 
go with your browser to the address: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

Ok, you got your first Vaadin "Hello World".
